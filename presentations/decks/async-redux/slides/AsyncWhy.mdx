# Asynchronous Redux

<ul>

<Appear>

<li>Up to this point we have only used Redux completely synchronously</li>
<li>No way to react to outside/async events (e.g.) API responses directly inside Redux</li>
<li>Instead fetch logic etc. had to be handled inside our components and resulting data had to be handed to Redux</li>
<li>However our components should ideally not be concerned with how these tasks are handled</li>
