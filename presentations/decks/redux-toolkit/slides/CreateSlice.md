# createSlice()

<v-clicks>

* We typically divide redux state by feature into 'slices'
* Each slice owns a piece of state and initial value
* Each slice defines which actions update the state and how they do it
* <i>createSlice()</i> allows us to create reducers, actionCreators and action types with a lot less boilerplate
