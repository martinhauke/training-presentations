# createSlice()

<ul>

<Appear>

<li>We typically divice redux state by feature into 'slices'</li>
<li>Each slice owns a piece of state and initial value</li>
<li>Each slice defines which actions update the state and how they do it</li>
<li><i>createSlice()</i> allows us to create reducers, actionCreators and action types with a lot less boilerplate</li>

</Appear>
