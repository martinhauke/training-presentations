# React Hooks

Functions that allow us to:

<v-clicks>

* Add component state to functional components
* Trigger side effects
* Extract reusable logic (so that it can be used by multiple different components)
* Perform optimizations

</v-clicks>

<!--
* Also mention other hooks (`useCallback etc.`)
* Show official hooks docs
-->
