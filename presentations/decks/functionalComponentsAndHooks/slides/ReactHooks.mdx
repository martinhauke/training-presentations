## React Hooks

* Functions that allow us to:
  * Add component state to functional components
  * Trigger side effects
  * Extract reusable logic (so that it can be used by multiple different components)
  * Perform optimizations

<Notes>

* Also mention other hooks (`useCallback etc.`)
* Show official hooks docs
