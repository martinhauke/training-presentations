# useReducer()

<v-clicks>

* More powerful version of `useState()`
* Accepts a reducer function and initial state as parameters
* Returns state and a dispatch function
* Allows to do complex state calculations and to refer to the previous state inside the reducer function
* Enables performance optimisations by having a single dispatch function with stable identity
