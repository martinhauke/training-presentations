# Side Effects

<ul>

<Appear>

<li>Are things that "change our world"</li>
<li>They <strong>depend on when, where and how often</strong> they are called (timing and context)</li>
<li>e.g. reading/writing to db, sending and e-mail, placing an order</li>
<li>Most important and most difficult parts of our applications</li>

</Appear>

</ul>

<Notes>
    - side effects
        - is misleading and leave a bad taste as it suggests that their effects are unwanted - but the opposite is the case
        - we call these to get wanted effects / add behaviour to Application
    - should live on the edge of your application
    - need to get the most focus and time

    - Redux enables us to model, manage and debug Side Effects
