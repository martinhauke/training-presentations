# Redux - Why

> What problem do we need to solve?

<ul>

<Appear>

<li>React is the V in MVC so we need the MC</li>
<li>Logic & State are contained in Components</li>
<li>
  Logic & State are not easily shared between Components
</li>
<li>Depends on your App</li>
<ul>
  <li>Small, self-contained Widget: don't use Redux</li>
  <li>Everything else: strongly consider Redux</li>
</ul>

</Appear>

</ul>

<Notes>
- context API is build as a kind of dependency management tool and to avoid props-drilling

- it _can_ be used to replace redux, but avoiding props-drilling is _not_ the use case for Redux

- in a sense, Redux and the surrounding business logic _is_ the App and React is just the view layer

- the M & C in MVC

</Notes>
