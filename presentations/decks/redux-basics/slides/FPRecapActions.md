# Side Effects

<v-clicks>

* Are things that "change our world"
* They **depend on when, where and how often** they are called (timing and context)
* e.g. reading/writing to db, sending and e-mail, placing an order
* Most important and most difficult parts of our applications

<!--
- side effects
    - is misleading and leave a bad taste as it suggests that their effects are unwanted - but the opposite is the case
    - we call these to get wanted effects / add behaviour to Application
- should live on the edge of your application
- need to get the most focus and time
- Redux enables us to model, manage and debug Side Effects
