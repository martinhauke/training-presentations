# Mocking

  <li>Mocks replicate some part of the code while changing its implementation</li>
  <li>Useful to draw a line between code that's to be tested and code that is "out of scope"</li>
  <li>Typically can be inspected if it has been called (and how often, and with correct arguments etc.)</li>
  <li>Allows us to return results needed for a test case without the need to interact with the actual code (e.g. an API)</li>
  <li>
    Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Non-deterministic functions (e.g. randomization)</li>
      <li>API-calls (e.g. <i>fetch</i>)</li>
      <li>Databases, complex classes etc.</li>
    </ul>
