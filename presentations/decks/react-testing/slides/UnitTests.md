# Unit tests

<v-clicks>

* Tests small parts of your application (typically [pure] functions/components)
* Helps to achieve/retain correctness in algorithms
* Very easy to write, because they simply assert a certain output by a given input
* Only give low overall confidence over the app state (don't validate if the "sum of all parts" works)
* Become harder to write the more parts need to be mocked
