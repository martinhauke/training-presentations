# E2E-Testing with Cypress

<ul>

<Appear>

  <li>tests are async!</li>
  <li>you can't use async/await and need to use <i>then()</i> chains instead (these are not promises!)</li>
  <li>cypress commands are serial and are triggered one after another</li>
  <li>cypress automatically waits for queries to finish (and opts retries)</li>
  <li>if a cypress command fails, eventually the test will fail</li>
  <li>cypress tests often do not need actual assertions, because each command is basically some kind of assertion in and of themselves</li>
