<Notes>

  ## E2E

  * e2e-tests are expensive, because they need to simulate the whole environment
  * however they are very powerful, because they almost behave like a real user and
    can tell us if certain parts of the app work as they should
  * therefore we should strive to cover the most important aspects of our app with e2e-tests

  ## Integration tests

  * More expensive than unit tests, but still reasonably fast in most cases

  ## Unit tests

  * Especially useful for complex algorithms and pure functions
  * very cheap and fast
