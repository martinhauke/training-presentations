# Behavior Driven Development (BDD)


<v-clicks>

* Done with tools like <strong>cucumber</strong>
* Typically done in a TDD fashion
* Tests are written in plaintext using <i>Gherkin</i>-syntax (or <i>Behat</i> etc.)
* Gherkin is just a set of grammar rules
* Tests are called <i>Scenarios</i> and consist of <i>steps</i>
* A step is usable Gherkin-text which wraps actual code
* Steps have to be defined programatically by developers
* Steps can contain test setup/fixtures as well as assertions
