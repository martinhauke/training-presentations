# E2E-Testing with Cypress

<ul>

<Appear>

  <li>Spins up a real browser and tests an application end-to-end</li>
  <li>you should only try to test what you actually control - therefore external APIs should be mocked</li>
  <li>network requests to APIs under your control -> mock most of them, follow a few critical paths for real e2e tests</li>
  <li>don't write e2e tests like unit tests -> e2e tests should test way more then a single button class etc.</li>
  <li>full e2e (you need an actual running application somewhere), so even API calls etc. are being covered</li>

</Appear>

</ul>
