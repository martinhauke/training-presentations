# E2E-Testing with Cypress

<v-click>

## Pros

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

* full e2e (you need an actual running application somewhere), so even API calls etc. are being covered
* screenshots + videos of the test results
</v-clicks>

<v-click>

## Cons

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

* slow
* it might be necessary to mock external services, depending on the environment the tests are running in
</v-clicks>

<!--

Recommendation:

- use react-testing-library for integration tests
- use cypress for e2e-testing
- depending on your app you might not need both

**Show examples in redux-hands-on repo**
