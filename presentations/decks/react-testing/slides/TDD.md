# Test Driven Development (TDD)

<v-clicks>

* Approach where tests are written before the actual implementation of a unit/feature
* Red-green-cycle (test -> implementation -> refactor)
* Helps formulate the requirements of a feature
* Reduces the amount of manual testing necessary -> fast feedback loop
* Removes the necessity to write tests afterwards
