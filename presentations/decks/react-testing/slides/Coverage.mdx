# Test-Coverage

<ul>

<Appear>

  <li>Shows which <i>LoC</i>, <i>statements</i> etc. are actually covered by running tests</li>
  <li>This can be an indicator on how well tested an application is</li>
  <li>However: this doesn't tell anything about the actual test quality</li>
  <li>Therefore an app can crash even with 100% test coverage!</li>
  <li>100% test coverage is usually not a useful metric or goal to achieve</li>
  <li>Rather use test coverage to find edge cases or uncovered branches etc.</li>

</Appear>

</ul>

<Notes>

**Run `npm run test:cover` in redux-hands-on-repo**
