# Test-Coverage


<v-clicks>

* Shows which <i>LoC</i>, <i>statements</i> etc. are actually covered by running tests
* This can be an indicator on how well tested an application is
* However: this doesn't tell anything about the actual test quality
* Therefore an app can crash even with 100% test coverage!
* 100% test coverage is usually not a useful metric or goal to achieve
* Rather use test coverage to find edge cases or uncovered branches etc.
