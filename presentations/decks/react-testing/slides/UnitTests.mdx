<ul>

<Appear>

  <li>Tests small parts of your application (typically [pure] functions/components)</li>
  <li>Helps to achieve/retain correctness in algorithms</li>
  <li>Very easy to write, because they simply assert a certain output by a given input</li>
  <li>Only give low overall confidence over the app state (don't validate if the "sum of all parts" works)</li>
  <li>Become harder to write the more parts need to be mocked</li>
